Why this plugin?
At times, website administrators need usernames in their sites meet some restrictions. For example, the username being an e-mail, to be writen in a specific character set, or have a minimun and maximun number of characters. Furthermore there are security concerns. The advent of Unicode character set with more than hundred thousand ones, gives users the posibility of writing his/her real names in their modertongue languages. But it also gives a malicious user the posibility of deceiving a true user performing an Homoglyph Attack. This is done by copying the authentic username but changing some characters for those (among the hundreds thousand in Unicode) that looks the same and phishing inadvertently. To avoid this you can choose the option "Unicode Security: Highly Restrictive level". For more info, see: [M3AAWG Unicode Abuse Overview and Tutorial](https://www.m3aawg.org/sites/default/files/m3aawg-unicode-tutorial-2016-02.pdf)
While it is not clear if Joomla will perform retrictions over username field in future, this plugin wants to fill the gap.
